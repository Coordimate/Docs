\section{Use Case Diagram} *UML use case diagram* 

\section{Use Case Descriptions} *Add an in-depth description of each use case.
This will provide further insight into how the application react to certain
inputs and stimuli. It will also give insight into whether the use case is too
specific or generic. Generic use cases can sometimes be split up into more
specific cases. Specific use cases can sometimes be combined to make a more
inclusive and intuitive case.*
